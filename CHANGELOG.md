# 1.0.1

Fix mouse coordinates in Ejecta when canvas is scaled.

# 1.0.0

Convert save data to async API so it works with Chrome Apps. This is a breaking change, so respecting semver makes me bump the version to 1.0.0. :-/

# 0.1.6

Fix scaling on Ejecta. You must now specify canvas.width/height in JS instead of HTML.

# 0.1.5

Fix font loading in Firefox. It doesn't like single quotes.
